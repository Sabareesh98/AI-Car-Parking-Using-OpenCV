# 🚗 AI-Based Car Parking Detection System using OpenCV

This project uses computer vision (OpenCV) and artificial intelligence to monitor parking lot spaces and detect which slots are occupied or vacant in real-time using video or image feed.

## 📌 Project Overview

Parking management is a growing concern in urban areas. This AI-powered system aims to:
- Detect vehicles in parking lots using camera footage
- Identify free and occupied parking slots
- Provide a real-time parking occupancy map
- Optionally alert or guide users

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🎥 Real-time video processing using OpenCV
- 📦 Predefined parking slot mapping
- 🤖 Vehicle detection using image processing or AI models (e.g., Haar Cascades, YOLO)
- 📊 Display of parking slot status (Available / Occupied)
- 🖼️ Visual overlay on frame for easy monitoring

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy
- **(Optional AI)**: TensorFlow / YOLOv5 / Haar Cascades
- **Input**: CCTV feed, IP camera, or sample video
